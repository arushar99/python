Arusha Herath's Encryption Decryption Program
======================================
Objective:To take a string/file contanining series of characters, then either encrypt/decrypt using default/user's key.

Instructions of how to use the program:

1)You need the latest version of python
	if you don't have it, go to this link and download it:	https://www.python.org/downloads/
2)after running the code, select an option between 1 and 8:

- if you select 1 (encryption by default key):
	- type the string you want to encrypt
	- it will return the encrypted string after
- if you select 2 (encrypt by ownKey):
	- enter the key file first (make sure you have the key file in the same folder as the python code, else type the directory of the key file.)
	- enter the string you want to encrypt
	- shortly, it will return the encrypted string
- if you select 3 (decrypt by default key):
	- type the encrypted string you want to decrypt
	- after pressing enter, it will return the original text back to you
- if you select 4 (decrypt by ownKey):
	- enter the key file first (make sure you have the key file in the same folder as the python code, else type the directory of the key file.)
	- enter the encrypted string you want to decrypt
	- then, it will return the string decryped back it it's original text/string
- if you select 5 (encrypt a file using ownKey):
	- enter the input file (make sure you have the input file in the same folder as the python code, else type the directory of the input file.)
	- enter the key file (make sure you have the key file in the same folder as the python code, else type the directory of the key file.)
	- enter the output file you want to save it to ( if it doesn't exist, it will be automatically created) and at the end make sure to type ".txt", make sure you don't enter the same file as the input file or the key file.
	- shortly it will be saved/created in the same directory as the python code.
- if you select 6 (decrypt a file using ownKey):
	- enter the encrypted file (input file)( mke sure you have the input file in the same folder as the python code, else type the directory of the input file.)
	- enter the key file (make sure you have the key file in the same folder as the python code, else type the directory of the key file.)
	- enter the output file you want to save it to (if it doesn't exist, it will be automatically created) and at the end make sure to type ".txt". Make sure you don't enter the same file as the input file or the key file.
	- shortly, it will be saved/created in the same directory as the python code.
- if you select 7 ( encrypt a file using default key):
	- enter the input file (file you want to encrypt)(make sure you have the input file in the same folder as the python code, else type the directory of the input file.)
	- enter the output file you want to save it to ( if it doesn't exist, it will be automatically created) and at the end make sure to type ".txt".Make sure you don't enter the same file as the input file or the key file.
	- shortly, it will be saved/created in the same directory as the python code.
- if you select 8 (decrypt a file using default key):
	- enter the encrypted file (input file)(make sure you have the input file in the same folder as the python code, else type the direcory of the the input file.)
	- enter the output file you want to save it to ( if it doesn't exist, it will be automatically created) and at the end make sure to type ".txt" .Make sure you don't enter the same file as the input file or the key file.
	- shortly, it will be saved/created file in the same directory as the python code.


Hopefully, You've love the code. Thanks for using my code.
